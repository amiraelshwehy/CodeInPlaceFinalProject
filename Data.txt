How to disagre - based on an essy by Paul Graham.
> Name calling: This is the lowst and most comon form of disagreement.
> An ad hominem attack: Not quite as weak. Saying somene lacks authorty to write about a given topic is useless
unless the queston of whether they’re correct hasn’t been addressed.
If ther lack of authority caused a mistke, fine, if not, it’s not a problem.
> Responding to tone: e.g. that authr was dismissive to x Still not addresing if the author is correct or not
and also tone is hard to judg.
> Contradiction: Finlly a response to what ws said
but still, just stating an opposing cse with little or no supporting evidence.
Sometimes this is effective, but usually evidince will help.
> Counter argument: may prove something but it’s hard to say exactly what.
> Refutation: the most convincing way to disagree, and also the rarest.
> Refuting the central point: The force of a refutation depends on what you refute. 
The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.

One thing the disagrement heirarchy doesn't give us is a way of picking a winner.
An advantage - it helps you evluate what you read.
In partecular, it will help you see through intelectually dishonest arguments.
The greatest benifit to disagreeing well - not only will you have better conversatons,
it will make the peple who have them happier.
There’s a lot more meaness at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top
you don’t have to be mean when you have real points to mke.
Ultimately, if you have something real to say, bieng mean just gets in the way.
